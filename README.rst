Freevana Player
===============

A free open source alternative to Cuevana's website. This player uses an off-line data base which makes it ideal to watch movies or series even when Cuevana's website is down.

TODO
====
- Try to listen for Flowplayer's "Finish" event to be able to return to the main screen
- Improve generation of Flowplayer configuration string
- Add support for setting a Megaupload user account
- Add support for premium Megaupload user accounts (can't test this without one, though)
- Add support for Glumbo hosted files
- Add a feature to check against Freevana Player's website to check for updates
